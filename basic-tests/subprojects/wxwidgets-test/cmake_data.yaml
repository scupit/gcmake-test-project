          # Visual Studio by default tries to build this as a console app (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE),
          # and looks for 'main()'. However, the wxIMPLEMENT_APP(...) macro
          # which acts as the "main" function resolves to 'WinMain' and causes
          # a linker error. The flag /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS fixes that by essentially telling
          # MSVC to build this as a GUI app, and therefore to look for the 'WinMain' entry point
          # instead of 'main'.
