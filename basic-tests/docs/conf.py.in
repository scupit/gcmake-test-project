# Breathe (https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the bridge between Sphinx and Doxygen. It
# allows Sphinx to use Doxygen's output for its own method of documentation generation.
# Exhale (https://exhale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) uses 'Breathe' and Doxygen's output to
# automatically generate a full API documentation hierarchy for your project.
# For C/C++ documentation, Breathe is required, but Exhale is not.
