# cppfront-basic

This is the basic test project for building a cppfront library and executable.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Read the [cppfront configuration README](https://github.com/scupit/gcmake-dependency-configs/tree/develop/cppfront) before building this project.
If you don't, your build will probably fail.
