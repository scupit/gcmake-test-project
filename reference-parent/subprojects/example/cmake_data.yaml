    link:
      - parent::reference-parent
      # These both work as well. Note that parent:: and super:: both explicitly reference the
      # parent project.
      # - root::reference-parent
      # - super::reference-parent

      # TODO: Add docs about the tradeoffs between using root:: and referencing the parent project.
      # Since all targets in the resolved scope project's tree and below are recursively available 
      # as a "toplevel" target, you can theoretically move projects into any subproject directory
      # in the whole project tree (including nested) with no issue when referencing targets
      # using root::.
