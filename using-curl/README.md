# CURL Example Project

This project builds a simple executable which makes a basic GET request to *<http://localhost:8080>*.

Before running the built executable, make sure you have a local server running on port 8080 with
a GET endpoint at the server root */*. [basic-server.py](./basic-server.py) provides this. Run it
with

``` sh
python3 ./basic-server.py
```

(Replace `python3` with just `python` on Windows).
